/// This module provides foundations to create aggregators in the system.
///
/// Design rationale (V1)
/// =====================
/// First, we encourage the reader to see rationale of `Aggregator` in
/// `aggregator.move`.
///
/// Recall that the value of any aggregator can be identified in storage by
/// (handle, key) pair. How this pair can be generated? Short answer: with
/// `AggregatorFactory`!
///
/// `AggregatorFactory` is a struct that can be stored as a resource on some
/// account and which contains a `phantom_table` field. When the factory is
/// initialized, we initialize this table. Importantly, table initialization
/// only generates a uniue table `handle` - something we can reuse.
///
/// When the user wants to create a new aggregator, he/she calls a constructor
/// provided by the factory (`create_aggregator(..)`). This constructor generates
/// a unique key, which with the handle is used to initialize `Aggregator` struct.
///
/// Use cases
/// =========
/// We limit the usage of `AggregatorFactory` by only storing it on the core
/// account.
///
/// When something whants to use an aggregator, the factory is queried and an
/// aggregator instance is created. Once aggregator is no longer in use, it
/// should be destroyed by the user.
