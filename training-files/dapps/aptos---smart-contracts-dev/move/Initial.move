    // So - what  is "entry" actually? Normal "public" functions can only be called
    //from other modules. If we want our transaction to start at "say_your_name()" then we need

        // 2. We require a "signer" instance in our arguments which will be filled automatically based on
        //   who signed the transaction.

        // Signer is not an address, we need to call "address_of" to figure out who signer actually is.

        // not true with Move. We can store data in any accounts (yep, with our contract's account too!).
        // So the typical pattern here is to keep data in user's account if possible.

        // Another interesting thing is that we can only store one instance of a given struct in an account.
        // So first we need to check if it doesn't exist yet:
        if(!exists<Passport>(by)) {
            // So if it doesn't exist then we can create/move our new struct to that account.
            let s = Passport { name };
            // But notice that move_to() actually uses "signer" instance, not "address". This is important
            // because you can't conjure a signer from air! It's only available if someone signed the transaction.
            // This means that we can only add new structs to accounts if users allow it. We can't do this for
            // any account. This means no spamming with random coins/NFTs etc.
            move_to(&account, s);

            // can modify it freely without needing a signer.
