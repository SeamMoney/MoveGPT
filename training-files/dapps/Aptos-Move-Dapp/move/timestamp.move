/// This module keeps a global wall clock that stores the current Unix time in microseconds.
/// It interacts with the other modules in the following ways:
///
/// * Genesis: to initialize the timestamp
/// * ValidatorSystem, AptosAccount, Reconfiguration: to check if the current state is in the genesis state
/// * Block: to reach consensus on the global wall clock time
///
/// This module moreover enables code to assert that it is running in genesis (`Self::assert_genesis`) or after
/// genesis (`Self::assert_operating`). These are essentially distinct states of the system. Specifically,
/// if `Self::assert_operating` succeeds, assumptions about invariants over the global state can be made
/// which reflect that the system has been successfully initialized.
