        //    can abort - when the counter already exists.
        // 2. When counter gets initialized - it starts with value 0.

        // this line tells us that if we have any abort that is not covered
        //   by "aborts_if" - it should fail. You can try commenting out lines
        //   of code to see it in action.

        //  so it will overflow easily. Prover catches that. It's up to us how we are going
        //  to handle that. Our choice for now - ignore.

        //   pre-conditions are met.

        // `ensures` is called on a state after function execution.
