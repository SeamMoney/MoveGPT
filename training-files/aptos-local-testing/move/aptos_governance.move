/**
 * AptosGovernance represents the on-chain governance of the Aptos network. Voting power is calculated based on the
 * current epoch's voting power of the proposer or voter's backing stake pool. In addition, for it to count,
 * the stake pool's lockup needs to be at least as long as the proposal's duration.
 *
 * It provides the following flow:
 * 1. Proposers can create a proposal by calling AptosGovernance::create_proposal. The proposer's backing stake pool
 * needs to have the minimum proposer stake required. Off-chain components can subscribe to CreateProposalEvent to
 * track proposal creation and proposal ids.
 * 2. Voters can vote on a proposal. Their voting power is derived from the backing stake pool. Each stake pool can
 * only be used to vote on each proposal exactly once.
 *
