# MoveDID Network

MoveDID Network is a MoveDID ecosystem formed by all dApps/Apps that adopt the MoveDID protocol.

During 2023, MoveDID Network is committed to supporting Github-related dApps/Apps to serve MoveDID developers and users, such as `Move-Airdropper-based-on-Github` (already launched), `Move-Crowdfunding-based-on -Github` ...

* [Move-Airdropper-based-on-Github](/movedid-network/move-airdropper-based-on-github)

  The `Airdropper`is an Aptos-based airdrop tool—it can perform Coins airdrops for the Aptos address list.

  It is also an extension based on MoveDID——MoveDID binds addresses in various formats such as Aptos and Ethereum to Github Account, so that Airdropper can perform airdrops based on the list of Github accounts, or it can target all the accounts under a certain Repo or Organization.
